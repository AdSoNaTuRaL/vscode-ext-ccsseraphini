  <h1>cc @sseraphini VSCode Extension</h1>
  <p>Base code for VSCode Extension</p>
</div>

## Getting started

First, install the dependencies. Then run the debug server:

```bash
$ yarn install

# then

$ yarn watch
```
Then, inside the editor, press `F5`. This will compile and run the extension in a new Extension Development Host window.

## VSCode Commands

First of all, you need to open Command Palette (`Ctrl + Shift + P`). Then few commands will be available to you. You just need to start typing `cc`, as you can see in the image below.

> Both commands do almost the same thing.

## Sidebar

The core of the cc @sseraphini extension is on sidebar.

From there you can write your tweet and the extension will do the rest.
